Portfolio website showing various projects I have created or contributed to.

## Development

Install dependencies using `npm`

```bash
npm install

This project uses the Tailwind CLI to generate CSS classes. To automatically generate
CSS classes when you save an HTML file, have a terminal open with this command running

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
```
